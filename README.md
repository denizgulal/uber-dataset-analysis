### Introduction
Uber has transformed the way people commute, and analyzing its ride data can provide valuable insights into user behavior, peak hours, and popular routes. This project aims to explore and visualize Uber's dataset to extract meaningful patterns and trends.

### Dataset
The Uber dataset used for this analysis includes information such as:

* Date and time of the trip
* Pickup and drop-off locations
* Trip distance
* Trip duration
* Ride type (e.g., UberX, UberPool)

The dataset is available in CSV format and is included in the data directory.

* Data Dictionary - [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf]


### Installation
To run the analysis, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, you can use Tableau for visualization.
To install related packages
$ pip install pandas jupyter

### Analysis with Pandas
The Jupyter Notebook in the analysis directory provides step-by-step data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library. It covers topics such as:

* Loading the dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Calculating ride frequency
* Time-based analysis (peak hours, days)
* Geographic analysis (popular pickup/drop-off locations)




### Visualization with Tableau
The visualization directory contains Tableau workbooks that leverage the cleaned and processed data from Pandas. Tableau dashboards include:

* Time-based visualizations (hourly, daily trends)
* Geographic heatmaps of ride density
* Ride type distribution

Feel free to explore these visualizations to gain deeper insights into the Uber dataset.
